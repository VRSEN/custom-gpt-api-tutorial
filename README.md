# Custom GPT with Third-Party API Integration

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the process of integrating a production-ready third-party API with a custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). Unlike using a playground environment, this project focuses on deploying a serverless API using Firebase functions for scalability and efficiency. The primary use-case involves connecting Google Analytics Data API to a custom GPT for insightful analytics. This setup can be adapted for various APIs, making it a versatile solution for custom GPT applications.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Create and clone a new GitHub repository.
   - Install Firebase CLI using npm: `npm -g install firebase-tools`.
   - Initialize Firebase functions in your project folder: `firebase init functions`.

2. **Service Account Setup:**
   - Generate a service account key from Google Cloud Console.
   - Securely store the key in the functions directory (do not commit to GitHub).

3. **Function Development:**
   - Modify the example function in [main.py](https://github.com/VRSEN/custom-gpt-api-tutorial/functinos/main.py) to suit your application.
   - Implement simple hardcoded token authentication for internal use.
   - Initialize the Google client (if needed) using the `from_service_account_file` function.

4. **Schema Definition:**
   - Define the OpenAI function schema using the instructor library.
   - Implement models such as `GA4QueryParams`, `DimensionSchema`, `MetricSchema`, and `DateRangeSchema`.

5. **API Endpoint Creation:**
   - Construct the API request body and define the logic for the endpoint.
   - Deploy the function using `firebase deploy â€”only functions`.

6. **OpenAPI Schema Generation:**
   - Run the schema definition file to generate the OpenAPI schema.
   - Update the schema with the deployed function's endpoint URL.

## Testing and Deployment

- Test the integration by creating a custom GPT in the GPT builder.
- Use the OpenAPI schema to define the GPT's functionality.
- Configure authentication using the API Key (Bearer auth type).

## Custom Function Integration

- Follow similar steps to integrate additional custom functions.
- Define new schemas and update the endpoint logic in main.py.
- Redeploy and update the OpenAPI schema as needed.

## Conclusion

Custom GPTs offer significant potential, especially when tailored for specific business needs. This repository provides a foundational approach for integrating third-party APIs with GPT, allowing for the creation of powerful and efficient AI-driven solutions.
